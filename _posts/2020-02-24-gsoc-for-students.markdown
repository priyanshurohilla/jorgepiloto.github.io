Google Summer of Code 2020 organizations have been announced
[here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/) and Open Astronomy
(the umbrella organization for poliastro) will participate again this year.

I had the opportunity to be one of the two selected students for the project last
year, developing new Earth specific capabilities. This year my mission is to help
students, since I am a mentor together with the original author of the software
Juan Luis Cano.

If you want to become a GSOC student, here are some tips for increase your chances
for achieving this objective:

* **Make sure you know how to work with the software**: you will not be able to implement
  new features or solve bugs unless you know how the different parts of the software
  interact among them. Run through all the official examples so you have a better idea
  on the workflow of the algorithms.

* **Select an issue and solve it**: this is key point. You must show that you are able
  to solve problems. This is the main reason behind GSOC program: you will be fixing bugs
  and implementing new features during the summer. Having merged a couple of
  pull requests in the software let us know that you already know how to proceed.

* **Check out similar software**: just a few students will be selected. Although previous
  advices are useful for increasing your chances, they do not guarantee that you are
  finally selected for the project. As an advice, check out other similar projects.
  But if you direct all your efforts towards a single organization and demonstrate
  you really know how to work on the project, everything should be fine for you to
  being selected.

Good luck to all students!
