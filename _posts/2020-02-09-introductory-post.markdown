Some days ago I bought a domain under the name of __"on-orbit.dev"__. The main
reason behind this action was to have a more professional e-mail nickname but
then the idea of linking my GitHub pages to this domain came to my mind. Based
on a Jekyll theme named *sciblog* and after some modifications, I was able to
get (in my opinion) a good looking and simple blog! 

Hosting this website on a Git platform gives me the feeling of having more
control on it, since I am not using a platform to generate it, just a static
site creation tool. The addition of a control version helps me to correct
mistakes and having a site layout history.

So finally, I took the decision of making this a  reference blog in the
orbital-mechanics and astrodynamics scientific computing field. The idea is to
post different contents on how to use actual and modern open-source tools,
latest news on the topic by providing RSS links to main journals and collect as
much information as I can. Of course, if you are interested on contributing,
you can always open a pull-request on the official
[repository](https://www.github.com/jorgepiloto/jorgepiloto.github.io).

Oh! Since this site is sci-computing oriented, we have highlighting code snippets:

A simple `Hello world!` script in Python:
```python
print("Hello world!")
```

The same program in Fortran:
```fortran
program helloworld
print *,'Hello World'
end program helloworld
```
* Item 1
* Item 2
