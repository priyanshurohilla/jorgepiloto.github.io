My name is Jorge M.G. and I am an undergraduate aerospace engineering student
really interested in scientific computing with applications on the orbital
mechanics field.

Contributing to open-source projects has been my main source of information
during the last years. I have learned lots of tools and good code practices
such us  control version software, continuous integration ones or how to
document, package and distribute your software...  

This website holds not only my professional information but different articles
on orbital mechanics, programming and different interesting projects that
reader may find useful for daily tasks.
