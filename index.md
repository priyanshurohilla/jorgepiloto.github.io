<h2 style="text-align: center">Welcome reader!</h2>

My name is Jorge M.G. and I am an undergraduate aerospace engineering student
really interested in scientific computing with applications on the orbital
mechanics field.

Contributing to open-source projects has been my main source of information
during the last years. I have learned lots of tools and good code practices
such us  control version software, continuous integration ones or how to
document, package and distribute your software...  

This website holds not only my professional information but different articles
on orbital mechanics, programming and interesting projects that reader may find
useful for daily tasks. Since this site is still under building process, some
links may not be working as expected. I hope everything to be ready soon!

If you find any errata or just want to publish an article, please contact me at
