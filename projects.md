## Projects

This page holds a brief description on the projects I contribute to. All of them
are open-source and a link to each official source is posted. By implementing new
features or solving related issues I have learned tones of knowledge, good
coding practices and tools!

<h4 style="text-align: center">Astrobook: an open-source book on astrodynamics</h4>
<br>
<img class="imgleft" src="{{site.url}}/img/astrobook.png" style="width:250px">

An open-source book that covers in detail all the topics related with
astrodynamics, orbital-mechanics and astronomy. My intention writing this book
is to share all the knowledge that I have acquired during the last years on all
previous topics while making a small contribution to the open-source community.

All images, figures and any other kind of content are completely free to use
with the only requirement of citing the project properly.

Currently, the astrobook is under heavy development and maintenance and many of
its content is continuously being changed. Once a stable version of the manual
is achieved, the First Edition will be published. Do not forget to click on the
star and notifications sections of this repository so you won't miss anything
related to the release of the book.

If you are using any of the content, please send me an e-mail to <a
style="color:magenta" href="mailto:jorge@on-dev.com">jorge@on-orbit.dev</a> so
we can show to the community that this manual is truly useful.
