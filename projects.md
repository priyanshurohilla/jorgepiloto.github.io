<h2 style="text-align: center">Open-source and collaborative projects</h2>

This page holds a brief description on the projects I contribute to. All of them
are open-source and a link to each official source is posted. By implementing new
features or solving related issues I have learned tones of knowledge, good
coding practices and tools!

<h4 style="text-align: center">Astrobook: an open-source book on astrodynamics</h4>
<br>
<img class="imgleft" src="{{site.url}}/img/astrobook.png" style="width:250px">

An open-source book that covers in detail all the topics related with
astrodynamics, orbital-mechanics and astronomy. My intention writing this book
is to share all the knowledge that I have acquired during the last years on all
previous topics while making a small contribution to the open-source community.

All images, figures and any other kind of content are completely free to use
with the only requirement of citing the project properly.

Currently, the astrobook is under heavy development and maintenance and many of
its content is continuously being changed. Once a stable version of the manual
is achieved, the First Edition will be published. Do not forget to click on the
star and notifications sections of this repository so you won't miss anything
related to the release of the book.

If you are using any of the content, please send me an e-mail to <a
style="color:magenta" href="mailto:jorge@on-dev.com">jorge@on-orbit.dev</a> so
we can show to the community that this manual is truly useful.

<h4 style="text-align: center">poliastro: orbital mechanics with Python</h4>
<br>
<img class="imgleft" src="{{site.url}}/img/poliastro.png" style="width:220px">

poliastro is an open source pure Python package dedicated to problems arising
in Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics, such as orbit propagation, solution of
the Lambert's problem, conversion between position and velocity vectors and
classical orbital elements and orbit plotting, focusing on interplanetary
applications. It is released under the MIT license.

This is the main organization I contribute during my free time and the one I
worked for during the Google Summer of Code 2019 Edition. If you want to know
how to use this software, please refer to the official
[documentation](https://docs.poliastro.space/en/stable/).

Original author of this project is [Juan Luis Cano](https://www.github.com/Juanlu001).
